        <h1>Tours</h1>
        <h2>Cozumel Island</h2>
        <p>The name of the Island is derived from the Mayan word "Cuzamil" from "Ah Cuzamil Peten", when translated means "the land of swallows", named after the native bird that live on the island. The biggest town on the island is San Miguel, which is
            also the island's capital. This also makes the town the tourist hub of the island.</p>

        <h2>Things To Do</h2>
        <p>
            You have the vehicle you need to get you around the island, now you need places to go and visit. While there are many places, like beaches, that you can visit pretty much where ever you are on the Island, there are few hidden treasures on the Island that
            can make your vacation special and fun.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>While there are many places you can visit, here are a few that we recommend you should visit before you return home.</p>

            <h3>San Gervasio (Mayan Heritage Site)</h3>
            <p>
                The island is rich in Mayan history with many historical sites found throughout the island. If you are an adventurous person who also loves learning about history, you can definitely make a trip out of visiting as many sites as you can. However, if you
                are time limited or would to visit just one place, San Gervasio is arguably the place you want to visit. Located east from the capital San Miguel, one of the highlights of the visit will be the Temple of Ix-chel, a God that had a lot to
                do with childbirth and medicine. This was an important religious spot, particularly for Maya women, who would visit the temple to give offerings.
            </p>

            <h3>The National Marine Park</h3>
            <p>
                The National Marine Park is a place not located that far from San Miguel, 7 kilometers to be precise, that offers a beautiful spot for outings. With its clear water, it is another popular place for people to swim and dive. Coupled with activities like
                swimming with dolphins, a sea-lion show or a crocodile exhibition, this is a popular place for tourists to visit.
            </p>

            <h3>Discover Mexico Park Cozumel</h3>
            <p>
                Part of the joys of travelling is learning a little bit about the local history and culture. One place that offers the opportunity to learn about the Mexican culture, both past and present, is Discover Mexico Park. Just as the name suggests, you discover
                the culture of Mexico through activities like tours, shows, and a garden showcase of Mexican landmarks.
            </p>
            <h3>Palancar Reef</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes the beauty of an area isn't only found on land, but also the sea. That is particularly true about Cozumel Island, with many beautiful places you can dive to sea the wonderful sea life. One of the more popular places to dive is Palancar Reef.
                This place offers areas that are perfect for all levels from beginners to experts.
