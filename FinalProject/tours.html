            <h2>Cozumel Island</h2>
            <p>The name of the Island is derived from the Mayan word "Cuzamil" from "Ah Cuzamil Peten", when translated means "the land of swallows", named after the native bird that live on the island. The biggest town on the island is San Miguel, which
                is also the island's capital. This also makes the town the tourist hub of the island.</p>

            <h2>Things To Do</h2>
            <p>
                You have the vehicle you need to get you around the island, now you need places to go and visit. While there are many places, like beaches, that you can visit pretty much where ever you are on the Island, there are few hidden treasures on the Island that
                can make your vacation special and fun.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>While there are many places you can visit, here are a few that we recommend you should visit before you return home.</p>

                <h3>San Gervasio (Mayan Heritage Site)</h3>

                <p>
                    The island is rich in Mayan history with many historical sites found throughout the island. If you are an adventurous person who also loves learning about history, you can definitely make a trip out of visiting as many sites as you can. However, if you
                    are time limited or would to visit just one place, San Gervasio is arguably the place you want to visit. Located east from the capital San Miguel, one of the highlights of the visit will be the Temple of Ix-chel, a God that had a lot
                    to do with childbirth and medicine. This was an important religious spot, particularly for Maya women, who would visit the temple to give offerings.

                <h3>The National Marine Park</h3>

                    The National Marine Park is a place not located that far from San Miguel, 7 kilometers to be precise, that offers a beautiful spot for outings. With its clear water, it is another popular place for people to swim and dive. Coupled with activities like
                    swimming with dolphins, a sea-lion show or a crocodile exhibition, this is a popular place for tourists to visit.
