                With the holidays drawing near, many of you have plans to celebrate them with family and friends. WIth the snow now upon us, there are plenty of ways to celebrate with family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                To name some of the awesome activities available in our part of the world includes <strong>Dog Sledding</strong> through the mountain landscapes. While most will think of places like Alaska when talking about dog sledding, but Idaho has
                a long history with an annual dog sled race dating as far back as 1917. The place to check out is Silver Sage Mushing, which offers dog sled tours located in Ashton.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another activity that is perfect for your holiday is <strong>ice fishing</strong>. With many lakes available in Idaho, accessibility is nice and easy, and the activity is perfect for the whole family and skill levels. Some lakes to consider
                are Bear Lake, which is a popular spot, Sandpoint, if you would like easy access to mountain town amenities. If you do not have the necessary gear and would like to rent, or go out with someone, Southern Idaho Fishing Exursions is the
                place to help you out.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you and your friends are the type that like hiking then the perfect activity for you is to check out some <strong>hot springs</strong>. There are many available hot springs you can get to right off the highway but for an all natural
                hot spring that is secluded for a more peaceful experience you will need to hit the trail. A nice place to go is Boise National Forest, located north of Lowman. The all-natural Bonneville Hot Springs stays open throughout winter and is
                about one mile from the road. An activity with a nice hike and relaxing hot spring bath in one.
