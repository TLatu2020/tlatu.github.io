            <p>The home page of justinmind.com is a perfect example of an effective use of visual hierarchy. The first thing to catch your eyes is the brief description of what the focus is about. Having it in a large bold font makes it really stand out,
                catching the users eyes. This is then followed up with another text below it, but at a smaller size, causing your eyes to follow that direction without taking anything away from the main text which leads perfectly to a call to action,
                being the download button.

            <p>The home page for this website, I believe, used contrast in a very simple way by using color. While browsing I found they used a change in color to indicate new or different content. Doing this allows them to effectively differentiate their
                content that is easy for the user to comprehend. Their color use also helps them contrast content they would like the user to focus more on by having it stand out more, such as using a bright color to catch the users attention.
